From the hotel’s side, Wanting to have a better understanding about what types of customers that usually visit the hotels, as in by analyzing the preferences of customers, as in what they most like and dislike the hotels, can make the necessary adjustments in a way that would satisfy those preferences.
Next, by learning about those preferences, if the hotels can identify certain patterns amongst the customers, then the hotels can meet those accordingly and increase their sales and profits
By understanding what most of the guests like, the hotels can make personalized offers for various target groups. By doing so the hotels would be able to maintain customer loyalty and to also increase customer satisfaction.
